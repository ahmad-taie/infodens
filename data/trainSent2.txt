All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right . 
Now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing . 
We know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings . 
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea , and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament 's position , as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted , clear as far as Russia is concerned . 
I do not know whether this information is correct , but the PPE-DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already . 
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind . 
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda . 
Madam President , I do not wish to reopen the debate , but I had also asked for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo 's motion . 
You did not call me either . 
I regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there . 
Madam President , we can not and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads , but also on our railways and waterways , not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster . 
As an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense . 
The renovation project , which lasted for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe . 
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit . 
In fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province . 
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time . 
All the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety . 
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards . 
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement . 
In this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who is with us here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale . 
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety . 
I should like to make just a few comments . 
Firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the waterways or at sea . 
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long . 
This is not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well . 
My second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards . 
In principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules . 
However , when it comes to safety , I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria . 
I can live with these minimum standards , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully . 
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation . 
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries . 
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 January 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN , that is the European Committee for Standardisation . 
Delays in the CEN ' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive . 
In particular , annexes can not be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments . 
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job . 
In this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today . 
Should the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the CEN completes its work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty . 
The amendment to the directive on today 's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community . 
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines , deletes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a ) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b ) enacting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas . 
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more powers . 
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999 . 
The proposal to be discussed today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , dates from May 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure . 
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure . 
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months . 
In addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out . 
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it . 
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report . 
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate . 
I thought that it was quite superb . 
On the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe 's roads , railways , and so on are as safe as possible . 
This directive is a contribution to this . 
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance . 
The rapporteur , Mr Koch , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this , has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN , which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive . 
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer . 
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr Koch , but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority . 
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously . 
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations , and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts , in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible . 
For one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them . 
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions . 
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at ? 
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made . 
Mr President , Commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes . 
However , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission ' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas . 
Nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities . 
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration , and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive , small and medium-sized enterprises , on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing , and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields . 
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects . 
I should be very grateful , Mrs Schroedter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations . 
Mr President , Commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one can not escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part . 
For example , whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased , there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect . 
Equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases . 
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently . 
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries . 
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development , improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training . 
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base . 
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed . 
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate . 
Mr President , Commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union ' s competition policy . 
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law , that is Mr von Wogau ' s report , and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe . 
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission ' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term `` modernisation '' to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression `` retrograde step '' . 
However , we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter . 
But , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper . 
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy . 
On reading both Commission documents , one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed , which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us . 
It should continue along this path . 
But , Commissioner , none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union , the deepening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation . 
Indeed , it is not just about modernisation of Community law , more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases , about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions , for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population ' s acceptance , together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned . 
Only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency . 
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there is nothing that could not be further improved upon . 
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question . 
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but Parliament is a supervisory body , and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one ' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ? 
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it . 
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though . Parliament is a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law , of all things , is truly scandalous . 
Therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area . 
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases , even given the Treaty status quo . 
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures . 
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions . 
At the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue . 
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts . 
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord . 
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example . 
But on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone can not achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation . 
Competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible . 
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition . 
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible . 
It is not just that we should pillory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives . 
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People ' s Party . 
Mr President , Commissioner , my contribution to today ' s debate concerns the steel aid code , that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission . 
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these . 
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly . 
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission ' s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in Parliament . 
As in other sectors , the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry . 
Under Article 88 , the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid . 
In 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany . 
Furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid . 
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996 . 
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular , precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether . 
In addition , there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece . 
However , there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report . 
As far as Parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired . 
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code . 
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe . 
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years . 
Consequently , Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry ' s claims about unequal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations . 
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind . 
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission ' s supervision . 
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires , steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity . 
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code . 
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments . 
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets . 
We also need to criticise the Commission ' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view , do not fall within the categories of the code , even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned . 
The Commission will be called upon , in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions , thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made . 
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions , I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves created , in plenary sitting . 
Mr President , as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there has been a delay . 
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau , Mr Langen , Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer , as well as the Commission , for their excellent cooperation . 
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further . 
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points : dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement . 
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate . 
At the same time , this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world , of course . 
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters . 
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape . 
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement . 
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe , then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission , by central bodies , but also by national authorities , by national courts . 
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally , it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty . 
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter . 
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion . 
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy . 
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted , then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined . 
However , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart . 
One is subsidiarity . 
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention . 
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation . 
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other . 
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although I am not going to talk about market failure just now . 
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters . 
These days , someone who lives in an old people ' s home is accommodated within the social field . 
However , I could also regard them as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is evolved structures , stifle competition . 
Apart from that , I could refer to any customers , any sector , as customers , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields . 
To conclude , I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across - the-board regulation by Europe . 
Mr President , the European Union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began . 
It is an integral part of the tension , inherent in the very concept of European integration , between solidarity and cooperation between Member States , with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy , and competition , which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity . 
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies . 
We can be proud of a European competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality . 
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision . 
However , we must be vigilant in the face of global operators , against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits . 
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s reign of terror . 
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check , not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan , or others , until we get the international competition law we so badly need . 
European competition policy , as we very often forget , is not just important for fair competition as such , but also for prices , growth and employment , and hence for the public . 
In common with the other Members , I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned . 
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken . 
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection . 
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament , as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations , consumer protection associations and the public . 
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy . 
Then it is possible to understand that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy , and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are , of course , bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context . 
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement . 
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis . 
At the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives . 
A word on the White Paper : the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy . 
I am opposed to this , unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group , because I believe that , in competition policy terms , the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met , and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation . 
The system currently in force creates transparency , affords enterprises legal certainty and has , without a shadow of a doubt , led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement . 
Mr President , Commissioner , competition is exactly what we need . 
We need competition if there is the least unemployment , for a smooth-running healthcare system , for social justice , for high social standards , and , of course , we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products , equal market access conditions for all enterprises , and environmentally-friendly products . 
In other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics . 
I often have the impression , unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded , that very often the reverse is the case ; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics . 
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this . 
But a system can not function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand . 
I will give you an example : the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained . 
But these are competitive jobs , for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany . 
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle , by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time , would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region ' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are , of course , dependent on too . 
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve . 
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics . 
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people ' s social welfare and boost purchasing power . 
To that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply . 
Mr President , the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe . 
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ' ban to be unsatisfactory , something I would wholeheartedly agree with . 
In other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse . 
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system . 
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law . 
We would be changing the law to make it executable again , which is something I consider to be unacceptable . 
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions . 
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provisions of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union allow . 
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped ; in other words , the Commission will be completely in the dark in future . 
This is unacceptable to my mind . 
The Commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States ' courts . 
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy . 
It would weaken a key element of European policy . 
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned . 
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition . 
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy . 
Forty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies , to the detriment of Europe ' s consumers . 
Mr President , Commissioner , Director-General , I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report : I welcome the Commission ' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules , and to propose practical reform measures . 
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau , who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification , indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken , and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion . 
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves , the judiciary , the Member States , and above all the SMEs concerned , that need to be clarified . 
I also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility . 
In practice , only 9 cases were rejected , 94 % of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished , non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines , which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related , staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement 
To conclude , I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform : fair competition and equal competition conditions , legal certainty for all enterprises , consistent application of competition policy , procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop , coordination of the national - and to me , independent - competition authorities , close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission , along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law , and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies . 
I am in suspense as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal . 
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year . 
I believe that Mrs Theato ' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here . 
It is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF , in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework . 
We will need the European Public Prosecutor ' s Office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for suspects . 
Unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity . 
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato ' s report receives more support . 
Mr President , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union , more so these days than there used to be . 
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe ' s citizens . 
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future . 
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law . 
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this . 
Now it is , of course , possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity . 
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level . 
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage . 
Now that is not a contradiction , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law , as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report , is actually about taking action in the EU ' s own interests , which , as far as that goes , does not damage the legal interests of the Member States ; on the contrary , it protects them , at least indirectly . 
The compatibility with the various national systems of law , as confirmed by experts , shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common , for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned . 
Taking these aspects into account , I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as proposed , and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF . 
Mr President , I would very much just like to add to two particular points . 
Firstly , I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States , although I am very much in favour of having such a debate , for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system . 
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion , but I digress . 
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato ' s report . 
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis . 
We also face difficulties with regard to offences . 
As far as that is concerned , I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome . 
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs . 
Mr President , rapporteur , restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us . 
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this . 
Parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to . 
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do , in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change , to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union . 
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation 
A legislative act , a directive , in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective , may enable us to take a major step forwards , and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste . 
OLAF , the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud . 
Accordingly , the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks , the ECB and the EIB , contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations , citing their independent status . 
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting , and I hope that Parliament approves this step . 
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions . 
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF , which was set up at the same time as OLAF , to safeguard the independence of OLAF , however it can not undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF . 
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point . 
In other words , there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on . 
There is one thing I would ask though : I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority . 
No , there must be no undermining of OLAF ' s authority , and neither do I think this was the rapporteur ' s intention . 
As such , I would ask you to give OLAF ' s work your full support , also in its present form . 
Mr President , as far as the second reading is concerned , the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament . 
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it . 
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Own resources 
Mr President , in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning . 
It is particularly bad this time , not least because it has affected a major European State ; an incident which could happen again at any time . 
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation . 
However , we must aim higher in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that . 
In other words , we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system . 
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today , and what the Commissioner has announced here , actually leads to legislation being produced ; in other words , if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers : `` you must push this through in the Council of Ministers '' . 
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe , which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods . 
I have no intention of talking about past events ; rather I want to look to the future . 
I will tell you a few things we should do . 
Of course , we need double-hulled vessels . 
That goes without saying , but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term . 
So what do we need to happen immediately ? 
We need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate . 
We need this at European level and internationally ; we need something like a TÜV , an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany , which is compulsory every two years . 
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle . 
This is what we need for ships . 
Thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the European Union . 
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges . 
We must reach agreement here , in all the European Union ' s ports , from Marseilles , through to Rotterdam , to Wilhelmshaven , Cuxhaven , and wherever ships drop anchor . 
Fourthly , we need the shipowner to bear liability , and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million , but to the value of at least USD 400 million , to be covered per insurance certificate . 
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability . 
We need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability . 
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision ! 
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability . 
In the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union , and incidentally , that includes the candidate countries . 
Last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future . 
The unions will have something to say as will industry . 
A long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen . 
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement . 
Just you go home and say : '' we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date '' . 
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports . 
We need to have a long memory when we say : '' for once we are united , at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned , and will not play one off against the other in the European Union . '' 
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time ! 
Mr President , I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies . 
However , we must stick to the facts . 
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years . 
The answer can not lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken . 
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls . 
If the Member States decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available . 
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing , rather there must be materials testing , for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue . 
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous . 
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial , but include materials testing . 
Secondly , I also share the Commissioner ' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path . 
Mrs Roth-Behrendt , we already have a TÜV ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies . 
Finally , we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements , for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up ! 
Mr President , it feels quite strange to be standing here again today , as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years , and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence , and not by force majeure . 
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through . 
The citizens are right to ask : `` do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever ? '' 
Who will provide us with new jobs ? 
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun ; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it is a joint European challenge . 
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio ' s action plan with open arms . 
It is equally important to note that `` prevention is better than cure '' . 
But there is an art to that as well . 
Deploying the German multipurpose ship `` Neuwerk '' - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help . 
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew . 
Valuable experiences were gained , and also the knowledge that we can not master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone . 
We are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures . 
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years , here in Parliament . 
The issue is as topical as it was before . 
Furthermore , I will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow MEPs , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation . 
Hurricane `` Lothar '' should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too . 
Current programmes must be accelerated . 
For example , as they stand , the Commission ' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto . 
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem , it shelves it . 
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term . 
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases . 
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate ! 
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons , roofs , traffic signs and , ultimately over the forest . 
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber , and this is only an estimate . 
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany . 
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days , then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual . 
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ? 
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to ; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree . 
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date . 
Mr President , Commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts . 
Firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , NATO , with the participation of most Member States of the European Union , flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom . 
We are now endeavouring , at huge cost , to get the country back on its feet again and help its people , and rightly so . 
Secondly , at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU . 
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims ' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders . 
`` We do not have the wherewithal for that , '' they said . 
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need . 
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms . 
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority . 
I call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will . 
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations . 
When , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament , I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier . 
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission , which will actually enable me to start work . 
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste , and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again ! 
Mr President , Commissioner , the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems . 
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters . 
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be . 
Of course , there is a need for solidarity here . 
There is certainly a need for European civil protection , and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters . 
But , most importantly , it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature , for nature can not make mistakes . 
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monocultures , if we are talking forests . 
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation , rather than monocultures . 
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate . 
To this day , we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream , and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff . 
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference . 
We must reduce CO2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make enquiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of Europe are faring . 
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well . 
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously , and at the same time , from my position here in this Chamber , point to how important it is to support these regions and people . 
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives . 
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry . 
In addition , I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production , for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions . 
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared ... 
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe , and I believe we need , in the long-term , to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future . 
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way . 
Unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future . 
As has already been mentioned here , there are indications - no proof , but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe . 
Of course , the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing , these storms will , of course , hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century . 
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours , Tom Spencer . He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time . 
However , an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP , for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate , rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability . 
We must be aware of this connection ; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course ! 
Mr President , it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority . 
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed . 
You are unclear about this in your White Paper . 
What is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ? 
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ? 
The final part of my question is as follows : when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States ? 
That is another point , i.e. the question of obligation , which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper . 
Commissioner , the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe , and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance , and that on the day that you present your interesting report . 
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it goes by , will be given influence over the Council , who in this authority will have the say in matters , and who will issue orders . 
Of course , we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content , but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam , and even extending them . 
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that . 
Mr President , Commissioner , in a few months ' time , hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday . 
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast . 
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect ? 
Mr President , Mr Patten , of course , you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China , and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate , something which has always been blocked hitherto . 
However , if your response was to be that we should turn to `` Mr CFSP '' , that is , to Mr Solana , then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter . 
Your approach , which I am very much in favour of , since it is a coherent one , takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights ; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights . 
Imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum . 
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this , then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve . 
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council . 
Mr President , I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting , which betokens peace and happiness . 
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned , rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace , serenity , compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans . 
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness , the Dalai Lama ' s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ? 
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people . 
Mr President , Commissioner , there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century . 
Of course , that falls within your remit ; my next question falls within Mr Nielson ' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation , in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures , which are the cause of great aridity . 
Mr President , the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission , to whom it was to be granted , had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity . 
Mrs van der Laan ' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work , and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997 . 
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor ' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year , 1996 , was denied . 
Since , on account of the college system , discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or , alternatively , denied or postponed , it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged , crop up again as Members of this body . 
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed . 
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control ' s proposal this week and grants discharge , then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque . 
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine , as a matter of urgency , whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997 . 
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme . 
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority . 
Mr President , when it comes to putting its own house in order , the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation . 
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission . 
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound , the more applause they receive . 
There again , it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen , and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks . 
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points . 
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made , not in every case , but wherever uncertainties or risks arise . 
I do not have exact figures , but the Community ' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller , to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office . 
This can not be ignored or evaded , certainly not on account of soft law , as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee . 
Irrespective of such legal considerations , it would be an unforgivable mistake , under the circumstances , to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are , at long last , no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms . 
As we see it , there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future : a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller , concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up , and finally , there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF , the new anti-fraud office . 
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten ' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie , which must be tackled . 
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked . 
Mr President , the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line . 
Therefore , the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order . 
As far as this is concerned , a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis , with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future . 
Naturally , this is only to be welcomed . 
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price , as it were , that is , of having to dispense with independent - and I stress , independent - prior approval . 
If you will pardon me for saying so , Mr Kinnock , what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes . 
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis , that is , in the operational Directorates-General , amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money , so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming . 
Indeed , the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ? 
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends , to a very large extent , on the Commission ' s own initiative . 
However , it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis . 
However , Mr Kinnock , your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street ; rather , as Parliamentarians , we want , and must , play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week , before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control . 
I believe , Mr Kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level , the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Patten , I should like to thank you for your statements , especially Commissioner Patten , whose analysis I fully share and I shall not , therefore , repeat any of his ideas . 
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which , for various reasons , a Member can formulate more openly . 
First , I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities . 
But we have enough agreements now : Oslo , Wye Plantation , Sharm el-Sheikh . 
We have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented . 
However , in this regard I share Mr Salafranca ' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week , namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum can not be implemented within the set timeframe . 
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations can not therefore be continued . 
I should like to make it quite clear : if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria , the problem in this region will be solved . 
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to : we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations . 
In Germany , there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay . 
That would be a similar situation . 
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union . 
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos ' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there , Commissioner Patten . 
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament , and that includes your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it . 
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos can not play that role in this region on his own ; the Presidency of the Council must take action , the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves . 
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution . 
Mr President , having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market , the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom , security and justice , a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other ' s competence . 
Commissioner Vitorino , although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable , words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us . 
It looked , as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee , as if the Council understood the area of freedom , security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein , security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will . 
Minister Gomes , I have , of course , heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency . 
I should like to raise three points which for us , as Members of the PPE Group , must be focal points when such an area is created . 
First : a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed . 
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers . 
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union . 
Similarly , it can not be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent . 
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda . 
Secondly : the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime , including by Europol and Eurojust . 
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith . 
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work . 
However , the Council should also bear in mind that , if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to widen Europol ' s remit , as decided at Tampere ; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities . 
We are not just calling for more control , and more control over Europol ; our motto here is `` Less is sometimes more ! '' 
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments , we may have a great deal of control , but it is inefficient control . 
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament , without hampering the work of Europol . 
At the same time , we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction . 
Thirdly : the extension to Parliament ' s rights in this context . 
If the establishment of such an area , in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens , is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats , while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake , then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens . 
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and , as we have already said , to strengthen the principle of democratic control . 
We want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizens of Europe , not against them . 
Mr President , all I can say about 1999 is this : how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter . 
I hope that it works out . 
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular . 
Since Tampere , there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent . 
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding . 
On the other hand , quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life . 
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future . 
However , it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union . 
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force . 
In Tampere , the question of granting operational powers was discussed . 
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control . 
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC . 
Parliament has amended the contractual text . 
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament ' s modus operandi . 
Unfortunately , no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them . 
Europe as an area of freedom , security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors . 
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe . 
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers , I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months . 
Mr President , esteemed gentlemen from Portugal , especially the Council representatives , you face great expectations on our part . 
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment . 
I refer to Eurodac . 
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system , as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications , in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and , above all , in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure . 
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be . 
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality . 
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see . 
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures . 
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures , in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities . 
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public . 
The question which I therefore ask myself is this : has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area , how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence ? 
We have endeavoured to provide material help . 
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action . 
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ? 
We know what the problem is : instability on the markets as the result of speculation . 
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us , is the result of speculation . 
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997 . 
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution ; instead they are calling for a new burden , they are calling for more bureaucracy , for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary ' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee , contrary to several resolutions by Parliament . 
In my view , and I say this quite clearly , the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused . 
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons . 
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable ? 
First , and the Commissioner has also confirmed this , because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets . 
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably . 
In addition , this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital , which is one of the central tenets of the internal market . 
Secondly , speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify . 
Thirdly , unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time , tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes . 
Fourthly , technically speaking , this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control . 
We need to clarify the liability for transactions . 
Having listened to the Commissioner just now , we know that the Commission ' s knowledge of the facts will result in a ` no ' to the Tobin tax . 
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say , and I think that they are right , then to take up another six months of the Commission ' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible . 
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote . 
Madam President , the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one . 
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies . 
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is . 
This question has now entered a different dimension , a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments , no more than 3 % of which have anything to do with the real economy . 
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets , not for the sake of the financial markets , but because this has to do with own growth , our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union . 
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past . 
We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions , but so far we have had no working set of rules , as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises . 
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information . 
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is . 
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice . 
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally , we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions . 
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission , so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure . 
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal . 
Madam President , we can not just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted ; we must also mention the fact , Commissioner , that 80 % of these huge , daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days . 
We can not maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares . 
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6 % of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea . 
We can not maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations . 
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable . 
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries , the other EU Member States , China , Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax ? 
There must be an overriding economic interest . 
Why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiated , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions , all the so-called cash transactions , currency futures and options ? 
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive . 
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise , but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold . 
Madam President , Mr Bolkestein , the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable . 
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means . 
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it . 
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable , except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions , or rather billions , into Switzerland . 
We all know that ! 
But now I call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital . 
It has never been done in south-east Asia , it has never been done in Europe , and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber , given Austria ' s financial record . 
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush ! 
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene . 
Madam President , I am totally appalled by the Commission ' s , i.e. Mr Bolkestein ' s , political ignorance ! 
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all ! 
Madam President , I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre . 
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades . 
If we continue down this path , and this is the ideology , and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy , then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions . 
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested . 
We have asset inflation of global proportions . 
As a result , speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets , causing growing economic instability which , in turn , jeopardises the entire economy . 
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result . 
We can take action against this ; it is possible . 
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last , not only by the Commission , but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe . 
That too is feasible . 
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble ! 
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer . 
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored . 
In short , we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other , because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results . 
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him ? 
Monsieur Bolkestein , je veux vous dire quelque chose ! 
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission . 
From a political point of view , I always fret when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these things ! 
It is not your job , it is our job to decide on that . 
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament . 
I just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less . 
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that includes the Tobin tax ! 
Madam President , as a representative of the Freedom Party , I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria . 
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights , having a sense of responsibility for one ' s own past , and the stability of democracy . 
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it , rightly or wrongly . 
The refusal of our government , down through the years , to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War , together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour , have done a great deal to bolster this negative image . 
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down , the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support . 
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here ! 
When we suddenly refused this offer , an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day . 
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind , and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ ? 
There is prejudice at work here , which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle . 
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda , as , for example , the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust . 
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti ! 
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda . 
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist ! 
On the contrary , you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did . 
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices , you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose . 
The attacks against Austria ' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people . 
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest . 
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy , the rights of the opposition , commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour ... 
Madam President , to begin with , I would like to make one thing abundantly clear : Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion . 
Austria is a stable democracy ; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary . 
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there . 
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria : there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections , in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found . 
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition . 
The Austrian People ' s Party , which I represent here in this Parliament , used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union , and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement . 
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria . 
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present . 
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship , many people were perpetrators too , although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt . 
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union . 
My country ' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ... 
... , with all the rights and commitments that this entails ! 
Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto , and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media . 
A declared belief in human rights , democracy and the rule of law , in an honest reappraisal of Austria ' s role in the past , in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century , the holocaust , will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ . 
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values ! 
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Representatives of the Commission , it is a black day for Austria and for Europe . 
They are trading this in for a head of government ' s position and for membership of a government . 
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one , as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens . 
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics , and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community , insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives , are grave and also inappropriate . 
However , my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage , is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so , Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties , ... 
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament . 
Mr Poettering , it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am , albeit for different reasons , for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions . 
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel , you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who , as I understand it , was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party ' s summit meeting . 
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play , i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system . 
However , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this , into our political system , and into the Europe of today , than any other extreme right-wing movement . 
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices , whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism , who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations , and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism , has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate ! 
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured . 
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - is sustained rather than kept in check . 
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government . 
However , by the same token , there is another Austria , the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government . 
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria ! 
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today , the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism . 
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy , or even against a relapse into barbarism . 
Please support the Austrian people against this government ! 
Madam President , it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics , but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics . 
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself ? 
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ? 
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days ? 
From all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen Haider . 
Who would want this to happen ? 
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ? 
Europe is a community of law . 
Democracy , respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold . 
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them , and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians , by virtue of their political culture , voted as they did . 
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did , and in a manner that goes against the Treaty . 
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic , constitutional and well-known European party , so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community , and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation , and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take ! 
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement . 
I have three short questions , the first being as follows . 
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice . 
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry , Foreign Trade , Competition and the Internal Market ? 
I am sure that your answer to this will be `` yes '' but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be ? 
My next question , Mrs Wallström , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors , for example ? 
Lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation ? 
In other words , will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ? 
Mr President , it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions ! 
Commissioner , I would like to come back again to my first question , when I asked about the other Commissioners , for it may have sounded as though I was in jest . 
Indeed you responded in kind , as I knew you would do . 
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked , that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union . 
I have good reason for asking this . 
As you rightly said , the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where , as yet , there is no scientific evidence . 
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time , for example by our partners in the USA , on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes ? 
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy , will not , as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors , keep pulling the carpet from underneath you ? 
That is exactly what it is all about , otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here , Commissioner ! 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , to my mind , it can not be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful . 
After all , we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance , that is to say , we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States , and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future . 
How , though , is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now , i.e. before enlargement takes place ? 
My group , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs . 
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand . 
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe , and , in particular , a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs , because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns , the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians . 
The politics of closed doors and private discussions ; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all . 
That is why we need transparency . 
I believe it falls to you , as President-in-Office of the Council , to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before , leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties . 
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going , and its outcome , rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent . 
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda , once the Intergovernmental Conference is over , whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future . 
In this way , Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy . 
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to . 
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , I wish to make the following point clear : neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter . 
After all , what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals ? 
No , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union . 
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone . 
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union . 
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens , and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year . 
Of course , we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States . 
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform , as the Council has resolved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny . 
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament , on all the issues you have raised . 
There is one final issue I would like to raise . 
Parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy . 
It is all about creating a socially just Europe . 
A socially just Europe is still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union ' s policies . 
- ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today , but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do . 
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative , and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today . 
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis . 
However , the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue . 
Furthermore , not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice ' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement , and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services ; barriers that are often impossible to overcome , especially for the smaller companies . 
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services . 
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here . 
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises . 
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement . 
All provisions , i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights , should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services . 
I , together with the European Parliament ' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view , as expressed in the report produced by the Council ' s Legal Service , is inappropriate . 
Consequently , I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned . 
I also believe that Parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission ' s proposal . 
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council , and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense . 
When it comes to acceptance by the Council , I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible , even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals . 
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis . 
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments , one of the essential differences is that , in place of a `` service provision card plus notification for each individual contract '' system , provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract . 
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms . 
However , in order to compensate for this , all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued , and as the Commission ' s proposal would have it , more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued . 
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection , not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter . 
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident . 
Likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued , namely under the terms of an opposition procedure . 
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States , rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States . 
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs . 
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months , and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting . 
However , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months . 
When it comes to self-employed persons , in addition to the amendments already described , we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent , and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment . 
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . 
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee ' s amendments , which they adopted unanimously . 
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions . 
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament ' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted ; whether or not one should use the number or date alone , or both , and how extensively to quote from them . 
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report . 
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons . 
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology , i.e. the correct way to quote . 
This would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future . 
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio ' s reports . 
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously , and I would like to stand by this outcome , which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions . 
That is why he deserves special mention ! 
Mr President , tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as well as the amended version . 
I propose to confine my comments to two areas . 
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense . 
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account . 
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment . 
Then there are the interests of the Member States , which , being on the receiving end , may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario . 
If we are going to abide by the one extreme , that is the interests of the Member States , then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high . 
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card . 
If I were to go to the other extreme , as few hurdles as possible that is , then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive . 
Neither outcome would be satisfactory . 
Perhaps this is also why , as is rumoured to be the case , the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well . 
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easiest possible solution . 
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis , and only in Denmark , then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark . 
Accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance . 
In return for this , however , we want early notification obligations to be discontinued , rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them , and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting . 
Consequently , I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . 
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission . 
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution . 
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country , then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card , as it were , for the reasons cited in this directive , which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution . 
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty , some of them very old , which are still referred to as EC . 
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law . 
However , before the elections we - the Council , the Commission , Parliament , the press , unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens . 
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU . 
They have now got to grips with `` EU '' . 
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver `` EC service provision card '' and not `` EU service provision card '' . 
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in , this is the one that counts in their eyes . 
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction . 
Mr President , Commissioner , first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner . 
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services . 
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises . 
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential , for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts . 
Why do I think we need the directive so much ? 
Three reasons and they are as follows : on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU , in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market . 
Therefore , whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions , I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible . 
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view , as this will have important implications , notably for the accession negotiations and for our country , which shares common borders with so many applicant countries ? 
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report . 
I also fully endorse his findings , in which , in particular , he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service . 
In point of fact , I consider this to be necessary because we heard , following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ' s visit to Luxembourg , that it is of course inevitable , a God-given fact as it were , that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service , and so more often than not , important cases handled by the Court of First Instance can not be given the attention they deserve . 
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here . 
For example , I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance , if applicable , and making this a final competence , in those spheres where benches of the Court , which resemble courts , pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law . 
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission ' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level . 
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought , as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions . 
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind . 
Where possible , one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance . 
In addition , we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs , not to mention groups , lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases , when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance . 
On a final note , I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law . 
As things stand , OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases . 
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court . 
Mr President , if we are going to discuss Kosovo today , as we have done many times before , then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo , or of whether in fact anything has been done at all . 
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality , and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate . 
As of 9 February , there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council , which will comprise representatives of the political parties , the minorities and civil society , and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament . 
This is a positive move and we welcome it , but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare , for elections are planned for the autumn . 
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result . 
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK . 
In other words , there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either . 
Of all people , it is the Albanians , who are now being integrated into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them . 
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work , urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs , Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country , so that at some point in the near future , on the road to coexistence , it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place . 
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about . 
There too , people are being encouraged to pay their taxes , for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors ; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources . 
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto . 
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way . 
One could do so once or twice , but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well , for there is a very large hole , as yet unfilled , that we are unable to fill . 
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Brok , for his report . 
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on . 
The Council ' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret . 
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should , and must , provide help swiftly , however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random . 
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point , which clearly emphasises that it is only possible , and permissible , to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public , communal and other authorities and institutions , which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK . 
Commissioner , it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations , in particular Pillar 4 of course , and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place . 
What is to be done with this money ? 
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights . 
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today ? 
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen : people are killed , people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit . 
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs , on the Roma , on Bosnians , but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians . 
I was in fact shocked to read in the report , assuming this is true , how an Albanian doctor , who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties , ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life . 
These are events and situations that can not be tolerated . 
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo . 
There are , at the very least , rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again . 
It is irrelevant , as far as I am concerned , as to whether it is Serbs , Roma , Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo . 
It is also irrelevant , in my view , as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo . 
What is all-important , to my mind , is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve , a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is , a Kosovo where people can live together . 
We need more police officers , as we have nowhere near enough . 
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights . 
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available . 
Only , now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo , and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use , notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary . 
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme . 
Firstly , however , I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Langen , for the truly excellent work he has done on this report . 
However , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout . 
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament ' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point , that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community . 
For in the course of the next few years , the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double , accounting for at least 12 % of energy consumption . 
To my mind though , what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing , supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan . 
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it . 
In this respect , the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment , and help us to realise our ambition , in the interests of environmental protection , the economy and creating new jobs . 
SAVE 
Madam President , I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate . 
Unfortunately , there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it . 
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts . 
I would like to thank the rapporteur , who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task , in conjunction with the Commissioner of course . 
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content , of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect . 
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied , but then only a tiny bit . 
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money . 
Youth , education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values , for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes . 
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union ' s goals . 
Cultural activity creates identity . 
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality , of an individual ' s own personality ; it builds relationships and communicates . 
We want a colourful Europe . 
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity . 
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences . 
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget , the allocation of funds that is , into the different types of measure . 
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures , because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals ; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom . 
Madam President , as we have heard , all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council . 
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture ' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure , for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests . 
In this way , the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order . 
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years , and now , at long last , the European Parliament can give the go-ahead . 
The Council could not be moved , not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael finished . 
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support . 
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered . 
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro ! 
There is a blatant discrepancy here ! 
We can only hope that it will , after all , be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day . 
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good , not harm ! 
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity , far more so than any transport directive , however important it might be . 
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance , and this certainly can not be said of all policy decisions . 
What , may I ask , is the Council afraid of ? 
Mr President , nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe . 
Even though they can no longer be driven , these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders ; and not just intra-Community borders , but also those outside the Union . 
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed . 
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking . 
We therefore have a number of amendments . 
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective . 
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive . 
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included , as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area . 
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either . 
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas . 
This is my main concern in this matter . 
In my opinion , the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe . 
We should not overlook the fact that , although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery , they are by no means the only point . 
Do not forget that , in the case of cars , 80 % of environmental impact comes through driving , 1 % through recovery and 19 % through construction . 
Quotas are not , therefore , the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility , just one of many . 
Of course we need to aim high , but quotas must not become an end in themselves . 
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars . 
It should not be for each Member State , but for you and your staff , Commissioner , to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles ( and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles ) should receive preferential treatment . 
We think they should . 
May I say something about costs . 
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers ; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer . 
However , this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling . 
I can only warn you against consenting to this . 
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car . 
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage , namely that we wo n't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted . 
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions , which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly . 
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer . 
As for a ban on certain materials : of course we need one ! 
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term . 
This means that we need a pressure instrument . 
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives . 
There are a number of sound amendments . 
This Parliament has been given more authority , so let us use it ! 
Mr President , Commissioner , reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks , one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe . 
Neither is correct . 
All the same , there is one point on which we are in conflict . 
In the grand scheme of the directive , it is perhaps a minor point , but nevertheless a disputed one . 
It concerns the issue of recycling costs . 
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year 's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs . 
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided ( and we Social Democrats are sticking to this ) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question ! 
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of ? 
For us this is straightforward : in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars . 
And what about vehicles which are already on the road ? 
Let us look at an example . Rover in Great Britain , if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars , would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs , whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts , as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it . 
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection ; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe . 
Consequently , for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs . 
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds . 
However , I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe , so that these jobs can be secured in the future . 
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements , as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions , but I believe that they should be the same for everyone ! 
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake . 
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection ! 
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious : to sabotage the directive ! 
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation . 
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more . 
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive . 
Do not continue in this vein ! 
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry . 
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers ! 
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry ! 
Mr President , there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars , although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy . 
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter . 
Firstly , Herr Trittin , the Environment Minister , was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet , then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop , having no expert knowledge of this process . 
Mind you , even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved . 
There are certain weaknesses , the greatest of which , in my opinion , is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses ; after all , the car industry is more than just large companies . 
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs . 
Consequently , we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars . 
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation . 
However , the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these . 
Mr President , Commissioner , I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate . 
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes . 
Should this be condemned ecologically , Frau Breyer ? 
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or , in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around , the manufacturer , has nothing , absolutely nothing , to do with ecology ; it is a simple question of competition ! 
Madam President , today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles . 
I have rejected the entire directive , not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House . 
I come from a country which manufactures 50 % of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable . 
Here , in my opinion , the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies . 
This can not be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment . 
I consider that this is a serious defect and that , in principle , it does not befit our legal system . 
In my opinion , this directive is unacceptable for this reason . 
Madam President , I would like to comment on the Florenz report . 
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down , the major groups here ( and above all the German delegates of the major groups ) have not , thank God , succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive , namely manufacturer responsibility . 
Unfortunately , there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy , i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years . 
We know that lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made . 
Here , unfortunately , the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry . 
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz , Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles . 
I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed , that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority , by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries . 
- ( DE ) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU . 
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State . 
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe . 
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider . 
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ . 
However , as politicians we must ask the question why 27 % of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999 . 
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results . 
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics . 
However , the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem . 
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution . 
- ( DE ) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ . 
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as `` Europe 's scapegoat '' ( or even worse , neo-Nazi and Super Racist ) to be counterproductive . 
Of course I , in no way , agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime . 
However , I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider 's adherents . 
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service . 
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility . 
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I can not condone . 
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them . 
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic , xenophobic and anti-minority . 
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments . 
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again . 
It can not be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions . 
The ÖVP ( Austrian People 's Party ) , whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted , is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria . 
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles . 
The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government . 
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic . 
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye . 
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left . 
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today 's session . 
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values . 
Madam President , I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about . 
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance ; it is just about the following question : when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive ? 
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to , and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible . 
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats ' request to hold the vote on Friday . 
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate , in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half , I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time . 
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic . 
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote . 
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda . 
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative , whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market . 
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities , and the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs . 
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion . 
The initiative adopts a completely new approach , which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships . 
The intention is clear : targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level , projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities . 
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House . 
In addition , EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans . 
It is an important Community initiative which , together with the three other initiatives , URBAN , LEADER and INTERREG , is financed out of the Structural Funds . 
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships . 
I consider technical support to be necessary but , given the problems with the former TAOs , no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament ' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level . 
Nevertheless , technical assistance is necessary . 
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice , with special emphasis on mainstreaming . 
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers . 
However , in this context , Madam President , to allow us to work out the details , I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday . 
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament , because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members ' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative . 
In this connection , the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament . 
EQUAL should live up to its name , and this is my firm intention . 
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life . 
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age , gender or origin . 
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support ! 
Mr President , Mrs Stenzel , ladies and gentlemen , before addressing the EQUAL report itself , I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based . 
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability . 
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy . 
However , the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people ' s self-determination . 
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives . 
Mrs Stenzel ' s report has , however , turned out very well , at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned . 
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes , although this should be self-evident . 
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee . 
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka . 
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago . 
Would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament 's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ? 
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility . 
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again . 
Madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ? 
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ? 
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ? 
Why has there been no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ? 
Why are there no fire instructions ? 
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident ? 
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced ? 
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves . 
Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today 's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past ? 
Today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there . 
So Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority . 
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo . 
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group . 
Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and can not , object to that . 
If your ruling is that I can not give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservations . 
I congratulate him on his excellent report . 
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently : the Paddington rail crash in London , the terrible rail crash in Norway , the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified . 
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament 's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament 's other amendments has been retained . 
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible . 
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety . 
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved . 
Mr President , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament , namely Wales . 
A major part of Wales , as you know , has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme . 
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face . 
We are looking , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality . 
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront . 
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality . 
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures . 
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects . 
We look to it to challenge the UK Government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure , is involved in the planning stage . 
Finally , we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent . 
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent . 
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales . 
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague , Mrs Flautre , who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill . 
I would like to draw people 's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism . 
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion . 
In the past , this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment . 
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament 's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action . 
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment . 
In her report , Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking , yet desperately needed . 
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund . 
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme . 
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the Member States ' annual national plans for employment . 
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively . 
Let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements . 
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today . 
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about . 
The implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service . 
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes . 
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration . 
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success . 
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enabling guideline , can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU . 
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks . 
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session . 
Key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe . 
In conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society . 
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions , financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment , assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy . 
Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular . 
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them . 
The report itself is well-intentioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability . 
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide . 
I would like to explain our thinking here . 
Firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds . 
Past experience dictates that , as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer , we should , and indeed must , demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money , hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as `` value for money '' indicators in the grant-giving process . 
Next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period . 
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful . 
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer , but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad . 
Finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed . 
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation . 
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects , which are hard to monitor , towards capital schemes where , in the majority of cases , the benefits are there for all to see . 
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform . 
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today , I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living , not by giving a hand-out but by giving a `` hand-up '' . 
I urge the House to support these changes . 
Firstly , I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated . 
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group . 
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament , as other speakers remarked yesterday , can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission . 
We should also have the humility to recognise that , if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission , but also by a five-year programme , we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House , so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were . 
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this . 
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships . 
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions . 
It should not be dramatised into something more than that . 
Mr President , concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today 's agenda . 
However , it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on . 
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today 's agenda . 
Mr President , regarding Mrs Lynne 's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building , I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower . 
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong . 
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem . 
Mr President , for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union . 
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament , I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project . 
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe . 
But all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market . 
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission 's proposals . 
I want to congratulate him , sadly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side ! 
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support . 
So although I may not share his conclusions , I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address . 
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy . 
I know that the Commission is set against this , but the potential exists . 
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation . 
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment , in which we have the support of the Commission . 
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area . 
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom . 
We all have , as it were , our histories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty . 
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy . 
But I really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business . 
Finally , we , as British Conservatives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority . 
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that . 
Mr President , I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so . 
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions . 
For example , the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion , which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990 . 
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy , which I hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale . 
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices . 
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element , and , particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that . 
Mr President , ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today . 
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top-up of 15 % for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000 . 
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace . 
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage . 
Mr President , this , as Mrs Theato said , is a critical report . 
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report . 
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80 % of the EU budget . 
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests , and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done . 
We need to take this responsibility seriously . 
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union . 
The question is : who prosecutes ? 
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States . 
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions . 
Of most importance to Parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the European Union , is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions . 
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal . 
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted , and that is not the case at the moment . 
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio . 
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question . 
Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris . 
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue . 
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation . 
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK . 
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about . 
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed . 
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date . 
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate . 
Heaton-Harris ( PPE-DE ) . 
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes , the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then , if there is some doubt , should we utilise the electronic voting system ? 
Mr President , I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general . 
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system . 
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure . 
I know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ? 
Mr President , in relation to the Schroedter report , I am aware , and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier , that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland . 
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs . 
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time . 
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report , I have this important reservation . 
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States . 
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether . 
In my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping . 
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments . 
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans , then we must have a level playing field . 
Illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment . 
There are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restructure . 
In all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained . 
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry , EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law . 
I enthusiastically support the report 's proposal to publish a `` scoreboard '' showing the amount of state aid per Member State . 
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed . 
Member States can not be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private . 
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling . 
Much remains to be done , however , and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe . 
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster . 
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes . 
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation , and last but not least , the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year . 
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union , not just certain areas of it ? 
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds ? 
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster ? 
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards , we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call ` ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters : rust buckets badly crewed ' . 
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively . 
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety . 
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster . 
My group 's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster , just as my group 's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions . 
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again , later on this year , discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea . 
Sadly , I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster . 
Mr President , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again . 
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future . 
The `` Erika '' incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe . 
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic . 
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying . 
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the `` polluter pays '' principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced . 
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ? 
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year , were a similar incident , just as devastating , to take place , if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice . 
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully . 
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner . 
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea 's power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential . 
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika . 
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources . 
Calls for design improvements in hull construction , especially double-hulled vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet . 
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection . 
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament . 
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media . 
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently , I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected . 
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife , in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks , have brought back memories of similar British disasters , such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967 , and have prompted many British volunteers to help . 
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage . 
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions . 
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London , we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10 % of the lost oil . 
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab . 
Ultimately , the polluter must pay . 
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25 % of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered . 
Moreover , although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice , I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations . 
Rather than banning flags of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet , under the 1995 EU directive on port state control , national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations . 
I sincerely hope that , particularly during the French presidency later this year , the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options , and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament . 
First of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy . 
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards . 
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this . 
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished . 
I think we should reinstate this budget line . 
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it . 
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic . 
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these . 
Mr President , I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms . 
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland . 
We had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of acres being submerged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water . 
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water . 
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water . 
Natural habitats were destroyed . 
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case . 
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force . 
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions , including the Commission and Parliament . 
That is very much the right approach . 
We need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together . 
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable . 
President , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern , Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper . 
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised . 
Once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed . 
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved . 
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration . 
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list . 
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material . 
At the moment the list is , as I say , a negative list and it is added to as required . 
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact . 
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation . 
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed . 
This is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done . 
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing , I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way . 
I hope that the next time you ask me the question , I will be in a position to give you more detailed information . 
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation . 
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind . 
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen . 
I also welcome the White Paper . 
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France 's refusal to lift the ban ? 
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting . 
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment ? 
In relation to the makeup of the authority : first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time . 
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months . 
I envisage that the board 's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders . 
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work . 
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that . 
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board . 
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament , through nominees or even MEPs themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated . 
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out . 
It must be visible . 
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority . 
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth . 
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end . 
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level . 
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advising , the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level . 
That is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future . 
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one . 
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern . 
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists , that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond , where experts are to be found elsewhere . 
Over time , as I said a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise , its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged . 
This situation can be achieved over a period of time . 
However , the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission , Parliament and Council . 
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward . 
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way . 
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance . 
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process . 
In relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue . 
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling . 
In relation to Mrs Lynne 's question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues . 
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority . 
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery . 
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and , although I come from that part of the world myself , I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe ! 
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean , what problems they have identified , what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise . 
Equally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified . 
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located . 
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and , in those circumstances , as scientists will have to travel , it is probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based . 
That is my judgement at the moment . 
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery . 
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time ; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda . 
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda . 
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu , Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards . 
According to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet . 
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting , construction , commissioning , operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority . 
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option . 
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999 , the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue . 
In particular , the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site . 
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency , the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana . 
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site . 
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries . 
I have explained the position of the Commission . 
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety . 
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable . 
In the case of Turkey it is different . 
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey . 
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria . 
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears . 
I do not have these concerns . 
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty , but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament . 
Thank you , Mr Bowe , for your question . 
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action . 
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment . 
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force . 
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it . 
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net . 
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict . 
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission . 
However , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium . 
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target . 
First of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response . 
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue . 
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used . 
This uranium becomes air-borne , is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far . 
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war . 
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects , not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo ? 
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ? 
Thank you , Mr Bowe , for that question . 
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo . 
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . 
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted . 
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility . 
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is , for the time being , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union . 
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States , as well as the United Nations and the Commission , something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment . 
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons . 
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to . 
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this . 
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do . 
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous . 
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise . 
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ? 
I can not answer that question . 
When it comes to medical checks and so on , I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer . 
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that . 
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information . 
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared . 
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including Tibet , firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities . 
The European Union did that at the European UnionChina Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues , including Tibet . 
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama . 
We are also doing a number of other things : in the European Union-China human rights dialogue , we have focused on a number of practical steps , including sending experts on assignment to Tibet , planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health , education and training for Tibetans . 
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them . 
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys , however worthy the cause . 
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is . 
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council . 
As it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the Council makes the appointment . 
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course . 
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world . 
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet . 
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice , first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest . 
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member , who I recognise is interested in these subjects , I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton , the distinguished journalist , on the problems of Tibet . 
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition . 
The Commission , like others , has urged dialogue . 
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes . 
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama . 
At or around the time of President Clinton 's visit to China , the President of the People 's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda . 
It would be very beneficial , not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People 's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue . 
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate . 
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure . 
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code . 
The Commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman . 
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission 's administration with the public . 
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities . 
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman 's office . 
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself . 
However , it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform . 
The newspaper reports were misleading . 
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman . 
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that . 
I want to repeat that honourable Members , like the honourable Member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it . 
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member . 
Both documents , that is the Commission 's document and the Ombudsman 's draft , cover largely the same ground . 
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis . 
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue . 
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , Mr Nielson , was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is , trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives . 
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development , part of the so-called induction courses for new staff , something that has been done already but not , I admit , on a regular basis . 
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management . 
As far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later . 
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on . 
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson . 
I must not go on about books , but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues , in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies , going back millennia . 
Thirdly , one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground . 
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said . 
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves . 
Since 1991 , the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia . 
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme . 
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million . 
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institutions . 
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 . 
In addition to national programmes , the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors . 
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind . 
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , Tajikistan . 
Since 1993 the Commission 's European Community Humanitarian Office , ECHO , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan . 
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and sanitation . 
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process . 
We were able , at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago , to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics . 
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them . 
I can send the honourable Member , if he would like , a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics . 
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well . 
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise , had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible . 
So the honourable Member 's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made . 
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact . 
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation . 
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land . 
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to . 
Briefly , just to follow on from that last point , I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission 's objections , such as they are , would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme , but simply that the Commission has a concern , which it has the right to have under Community law , to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify . 
Mr President , the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so . 
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that is , by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers ' money in Europe . 
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so . 
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock . 
From what I have seen of the reform process , it looks good . 
But we need that reform process . 
Many of the general points raised in our committee 's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan 's report . 
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it . 
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports , a series of details . 
It groups them together and that is very important . 
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms . 
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending . 
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue . 
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored . 
Mr President , we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform . 
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures . 
It is fair to say that the new President , Mr Prodi , and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament . 
However , the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives . 
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed . 
Mr President , this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the European Commission . 
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that : `` It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility '' . 
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team . 
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal . 
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition ; a new , reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office . 
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform , which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today . 
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function . 
The Commission , in my opinion , has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated . 
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong , honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner ; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels ; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential . 
In order to achieve this , action is required in four areas . 
First , financial management and control within the Commission must be improved . 
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control . 
The Commission 's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure , including financial control . 
In return for this greater degree of autonomy , managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions . 
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time . 
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes . 
Second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened , firstly by creating a culture in which they can not thrive . 
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly , by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud . 
OLAF , the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts , criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions . 
A proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , by the middle of this year . 
Third , standards in European public life must be upheld . 
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct . 
A number of codes have since been introduced . 
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding . 
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management , they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong . 
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue . 
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive . 
Too many young , new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years . 
Merit must be recognised and rewarded , specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade . 
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent . 
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed . 
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions . 
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements ; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who can not understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders , or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States . 
Commissioner Kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform . 
This communication must contain a clear timetable . 
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be . 
In June of last year Europe 's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism . 
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957 . 
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget ; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons ; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself , are now part of European folklore . 
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated . 
Remember that the Council of Ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March . 
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September . 
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored . 
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials . 
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months , which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency . 
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly . 
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly , it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode . 
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information . 
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee . 
We could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package . 
The less precise , Mr van Hulten , we are in our resolutions , the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like . 
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report should be implemented . 
We have , as the EPP-ED group , submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report , entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee . 
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , Commissioner , accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct , particularly when considering appointments and promotion . 
Looking to the future , we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission . 
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals . 
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible . 
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget . 
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions . 
But , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination . 
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform . 
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced . 
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far . 
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission . 
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation . 
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission . 
We can not continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service . 
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit . 
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because , unlike what Mr Elles has just said , the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March . 
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones . 
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history . 
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves . 
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process . 
Finally , can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public . 
European taxpayers need to be re-assured . 
The fate of the Commission , of the whole European Union , rests on delivery of this reform . 
That is the key issue , delivery of these proposals . 
Mr President , I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it . 
So I refer to the things I do not agree with . 
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament . 
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission . 
In addition to that , there is the question of duty-free . 
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports . 
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either . 
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission . 
After all , it is only 1 % of GDP , by comparison with national spending . 
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80 % of these resources are spent by the Member States . 
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money . 
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust . 
If there is , we have generated it in this House in the past year . 
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council , the Commission and Parliament . 
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted , doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs . 
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were . 
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it . 
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far . 
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission 's - it was the decision of this Parliament ! 
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House . 
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House , there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full , formally and in detail for everything I have done . 
Mr President , may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and , from what I hear , the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report . 
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects , certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance , as several Members have said , to all of our Institutions . 
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative . 
Mr President , as you will know , Mr van Hulten 's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and , since I want to make a comprehensive reply , particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control , I seek your indulgence . 
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary . 
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September , I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission 's reform proposals . 
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today , well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago . 
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that . 
The great majority of the paper 's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform . 
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile . 
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance . 
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode . 
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing , it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing . 
Hence the transmission . 
Though time forbids me , Mr President , from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House , I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas . 
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations . 
The need for transparency is rightly stressed , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does . 
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this House , but more generally to the European public . 
Naturally , sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information , but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible . 
I have repeatedly emphasised that , indeed not just as a Commissioner , but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning . 
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission . 
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform . 
As the House knows and has repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the Union 's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures . 
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today 's debate . 
We share the view , forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts , and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures . 
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April . 
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital . 
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law . 
Change in the law is fundamental . 
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy , but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system . 
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget . 
In addition , and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system , the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - `` the second key '' as Herr Bösch said , established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts . 
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague , Mrs Schreyer , who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening . 
As Budgets Commissioner , here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors . 
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits . 
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them . 
The proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes . 
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called `` a big bang approach '' . 
Financial control ' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate . 
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts . 
In addition , I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997 . 
For instance , the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered . 
At the same time , the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies , notably the same Financial Controller , the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General . '' 
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but , over the years , it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions . 
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this . 
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition . 
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document . 
Our objective , the committee ' s objective , the Court of Auditors ' objective is not to abolish financial control , it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control . 
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months . 
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing . 
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions , we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed . 
Since June of last year , the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities . 
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line . 
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed . 
We are seeking to implement best practice . 
Serious response to reports , confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure . 
As a corollary , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations . 
A communication later this year will give full details . 
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change . 
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House . 
I welcome Parliament 's support for that . 
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents , made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten 's report . 
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission 's accountability to this Parliament . 
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors . 
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible . 
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform . 
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment , training , appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals . 
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions . 
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities . 
Members , who , in the course of this debate , have properly praised Commission officials , who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity , hard-working and of great capability , are absolutely right in the comments that they have made . 
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points , detail and precision are obviously essential . 
It is , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations . 
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay , conditions , staff representation rights and so on , but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters . 
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome . 
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called `` negative priorities '' and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity . 
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management . 
I want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission , it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission . 
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten 's report . 
I conclude , Mr President , by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur , to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions . 
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then , most important of all , working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities . 
Mr President , firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today , particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process , and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of `` banker '' for the entire operation . 
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended . 
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date . 
Nevertheless , we can not deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late . 
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome . 
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East . 
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel , the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum . 
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security . 
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising . 
On the issue of Palestine , I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement . 
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , I believe , these talks will not be held up indefinitely . 
At present , the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first , while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security . 
Currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed . 
In conclusion , while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process , Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward . 
I sincerely hope that , in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East , all the key protagonists will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved . 
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown . 
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress . 
It is essential to establish a single European system , but one based on fairness , full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions , including an end to routine detention . 
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years . 
The second area is that of freedom : freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals . 
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom , not just about repression . 
Whatever the Eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters . 
Finally , as has already been said , it is essential , and I hope that the IGC will cover this , to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas , with democratic and judicial scrutiny . 
Mr President , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice . 
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees . 
The level of racism in our society is terrifying . 
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time . 
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up . 
There is a willingness but fear pervades , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union . 
Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony . 
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists . 
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons , nor have the loyalist terrorists , yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community . 
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed . 
Between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people . 
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193 , while those against republicans totalled 97 . 
Since January 2000 , there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans , loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults , one leading to another murder , while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults . 
Mr President , that situation can not continue and needs remedying . 
Mr President , unlike some of the previous speakers , I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino . 
This trio 's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said . 
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated . 
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months . 
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune . 
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months . 
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union . 
One area though is extremely important , and this House must be involved in it : namely scrutiny . 
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised , that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it . 
And we must make certain that the details are applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different countries . 
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon , one or two of which were referred to earlier on . 
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime . 
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about . 
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system , for example . 
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this , but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail . 
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of ` scoreboard ' . 
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is . 
A scoreboard tells people the score ; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible . 
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so . 
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening . 
Mr President , I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry , Mr Costa , and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed . 
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows . 
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament . 
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together ; we have been sizing each other up , we have had a few minor spats , but we need to work effectively together . 
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process . 
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area . 
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission . 
We have established a new Directorate-General , yet it has only 70 people all told . 
There is an agreement to double this number , but I understand that , so far , not a single new person has arrived . 
We are setting the Commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard . 
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs . 
Finally , on the content of the debate , I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda . 
All good things come in threes , especially in our policy area . 
Two hundred years ago it was liberty , equality and fraternity , and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others . 
Now it is freedom , security and justice , and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security , important as it is , above the equally important needs of freedom and justice . 
Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner . 
I thank them for their statements to the House . 
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies . 
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States . 
Thank you , Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council . 
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog . 
However , forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me . 
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately . 
Will you please therefore undertake , before the next plenary in February , to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public , immediately the Council has passed legislation , rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list . 
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ? 
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming , mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs . 
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks , in particular , against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where , of course , European standards of food safety do not apply . 
Mr President , I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber . 
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field . 
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency . 
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level . 
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States . 
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position . 
But there are some questions still outstanding . 
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme . 
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict . 
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue . 
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa . 
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought , where the crops have failed , and where , in six months ' time , we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands . 
At the same time , there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns , after which we will send the bread . 
Mr President , I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency . 
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it , you would consider it . 
Well , I , and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it . 
I appreciate that it is a provocative question . 
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves . 
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens . 
Madam President , I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders . 
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary . 
In the last 30 years , the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times : firstly , total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading ; secondly , annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350 , that is , 1 % of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99 % are for speculation . 
The size , unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies . 
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche , burying jobs , lives and industries across the globe . 
The only arguments against it are : firstly , it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world , in East Asia , Europe and Latin America . 
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy . 
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators , stockbrokers and option traders . 
Of course , this can not be done in one country ; it can not be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation . 
Europe , Japan and the US - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block . 
I am disappointed in the EPP . 
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on . 
Yes , I am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow . 
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter , to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax . 
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax , but I can not understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue . 
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind . 
The tax has the support of 47 % of the people in the UK , according to a recent survey by War on Want . 
In France it has had enormous resonance , particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty . 
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament , the Council or the Commission . 
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than : `` It has not been done before '' . 
In the new millennium , with new global problems requiring new global solutions , they need to give good arguments why it can not be done now , rather than why it has not been done in the past . 
Madam President , we are not asking for more bureaucracy , as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago . 
We are looking for solutions . 
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea . 
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question . 
`` The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation , the more rules are needed '' , as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle . 
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union 's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations . 
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary , all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions . 
We citizens of the world can not afford the current rate of speculation . 
To continue would be economic suicide . 
Madame President , my group , the EDD , and especially my party , are very concerned by this debate . 
We can not , and we do not , support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich . 
We also , however , deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the European Union . 
My party at home are certainly not racists , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well . 
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain ' s Parliament if we are elected ? 
Madame President , the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament . 
I believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government . 
Your Parliament , may I suggest , Madame President , should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country . 
Then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected . 
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , Madame President and only then , may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union . 
Madam President , this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa , who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States . 
This debate , and the background to it , reinforced the point that the Council , the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists . 
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of Austria ' s Freedom Party . 
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history , in particular World War II , but also its policies on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the European Union itself . 
We were also outraged , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excesses of the former USSR . 
Even today , surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China ' s Communist Party . 
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments , or in German state governments , or even the British government ' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today . 
This , Madam President , is the hypocrisy of the left . 
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards , especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States . 
That should be our task , not political posturing . 
Madam President , they say , where I come from , ` it ' s three times for a Welshman ' , and three times , as I think you will discover in the course of that debate , I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent , and on several occasions , a moving debate . 
First of all , could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday . 
I must respond also to the fact , of course , that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity , the complacency and the fragility of the Commission ' s opinion . 
I am duty - bound to say to this House , there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered , or indeed the action taken , by the Commission on this issue . 
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the President this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday . 
Secondly , we said , in very specific terms , that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria . 
Thirdly , we expressed , in very explicit terms , that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty ; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld . 
There is no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all . 
And , when I say that the Commission took that view , I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler , who is from Austria ; and who , once again , demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission , under oath , in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning . 
Anyone , therefore , who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian , should examine their own motives in the context of a debate , which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world . 
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , Franz Fischler . 
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday . 
We will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour . 
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider ' s offensive statements , the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies , sometimes on successive days . 
We understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism . 
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning . 
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate , ` necessarily with acute vigilance ' . 
I wonder , since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber , whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government . 
Does the Commission support the Council ? 
Madam President , when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view , I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning , as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue , it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States . 
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen . 
The precautionary principle is not a new concept . 
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas , environmental , human , animal and plant health ; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht . 
It also appears in a range of international texts , for example , the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol . 
However , the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years . 
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary . 
In view of this growing interest , the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle . 
The basic aim of the communication is twofold . 
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles . 
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism . 
The Commission ' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental , human , animal and plant health . 
Of course , this objective can not be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures , but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear . 
As such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science , as some have alleged , it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics . 
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society . 
It is therefore political by nature . 
However , the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper . 
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut . 
They must be non-discriminatory in their application , that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin . 
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken . 
For example , if one product has been approved , similar products should also be approved . 
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action ; that is , the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment , that is the burden of proof . 
All these elements have to apply cumulatively . 
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use . 
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level . 
Of course , this is shared by the whole Commission . 
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us , David Byrne , Erkki Liikanen and myself , but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today . 
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission . 
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document . 
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental areas . 
It has been mainly used in the environmental field , but , of course also when it comes to human health . 
So , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it . 
Who will take the decision , who are the decision-makers ? 
They have to look at , for example , the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case . 
That is , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science . 
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done , but there is no question of changing the scientific base . 
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that is available . 
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science . 
Then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not . 
So , there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today . 
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier . 
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ? 
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops . 
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do ? 
Mr President , for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee . 
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened . 
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC . 
It is more a question of nine minutes , perhaps nine hours if it is difficult , locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects , not nine months . 
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda . 
There is time . 
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda . 
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view . 
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles . 
I thank the Commission for doing that even if , of course , I do not agree with everything the Commission said . 
The Parliament , the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda . 
I wish you every success , President of the Council , in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine ' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion , also when the French Presidency takes over , by the end of this year . 
It makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights . 
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States , especially Britain and France , seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty . 
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty . 
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court . 
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention . 
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy . 
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent . 
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon . 
On 14 February , we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000 . 
This is a big task but it can be done . 
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement . 
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important `` Amsterdam leftovers '' . 
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe . 
In relation to the latter point , Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining . 
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers , provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission . 
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point . 
At the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution . 
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty . 
In other words , if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions . 
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully . 
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents . 
The Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe . 
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about . 
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament . 
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly . 
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700 , bring in 26 % more population over time , and then adopt the Commission ' s , I think ill-considered , proposition , that there should be a European list of candidates . 
What will happen to a place like Scotland , which I represent here ? 
It will become totally invisible ! 
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions , people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones . 
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view . 
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed . 
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism . 
This directive is , of course , not in itself directly about that . 
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market , creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed . 
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger . 
We welcome that , and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision , we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law . 
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks . 
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process . 
For that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals . 
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice . 
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT . 
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court . 
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative , but Europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning . 
Mr President , I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work . 
Furthermore , if the courts can not deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them , what happens , as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out , is that justice delayed becomes , as we know , justice denied . 
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem . 
However , as Mr Marinho has pointed out , more is necessary , but that has to wait for the IGC , 
In my own country , mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges . 
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system . 
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union ' s disputes resolution procedures . 
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable . 
What is happening in France , Mr President , appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties . 
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings . 
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this . 
Mr President , may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work . 
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future . 
For this reason , I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises . 
As the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities . 
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which falls within Ireland ' s only Objective I region . 
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions , including the energy sector . 
In short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies . 
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States . 
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round , which is not always the case . 
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form . 
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there . 
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading . 
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re-instatement of the Commission ' s original budget . 
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable . 
During the procedure , agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise , implement , complement and assess the Community measures . 
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and , very importantly , the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency . 
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress . 
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council ' s very meagre opening offer . 
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount . 
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under . 
This was an important consideration for us . 
I would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real . 
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level , this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , including Community actions , on energy saving . 
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region . 
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard . 
It focuses on non-technical elements , helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted . 
It is something that we can all support . 
I have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving . 
We could do rather more , considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports . 
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do . 
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process . 
Madam President , I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri . 
Both of them have done a first-class job . 
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it is ; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important . 
Why do I say that culture is important ? 
Well in simple economic terms , Europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity . 
Where would Europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ? 
But , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civilised . 
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs ; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy . 
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heaven ' s sake . 
We do drink port wine , and we do like German beer , and we even use Finnish saunas , but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat . 
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola , eating hamburgers , wearing baseball caps , watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time . 
So , I say to the Council of Ministers : Keep this programme genuinely under review . 
And , I say to Madame Reding , thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your side . 
Madam President , may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry . 
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000 , having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate . 
Again , because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward , we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community . 
The fundamental question , it seems to me , that faces this Parliament , the Commission and the Council is : What is Europe ? 
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries ? 
Europe is its people , its history and now its collectivity ; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this : I will wager that when we ask the question - ` What is Europe ? ' - we answer it by saying , ` It is our art , it is our literature and it is our heritage . ' 
And more than this - and this is more prosaic , Madam President , it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive , that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require . 
It promotes mobility , and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded . 
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver . 
Mr President , I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament , as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe . 
Car manufacturers , the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars . 
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union . 
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years . 
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations . 
Mr President , this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life . 
To that extent , it might be thought desirable , even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity . 
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year ? 
Who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ? 
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made ? 
The proposal from the Council , the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot . 
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many , many more decades than companies from Japan , Korea and elsewhere , that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere . 
Retrospective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law . 
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest , which clearly there is not in this case . 
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this . 
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality , which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry . 
Mr President , this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled . 
Now who should pay the costs ? 
Whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer . 
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars . 
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals . 
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers ! 
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments . 
Mr President , this is an extremely bad directive . 
First of all , as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out , it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle . 
Secondly , it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment . 
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment . 
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago , I believe , by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles , to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them . 
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars . 
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and can not economically do so . 
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars , recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts . 
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the `` dead '' car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process . 
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive , it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally , and are certainly very damaging economically . 
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments . 
There are few things more certain in life than taxes , death and pollution . 
However , there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives . 
When it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good . 
In fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good . 
As is so often the case , it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem , which will only serve to create more jobs for officials , and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money . 
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut . 
No one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged , but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity . 
Thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles , to encourage private sector recycling companies , through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements , and to incentivise the use of recycled materials . 
Of course , these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction . 
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report . 
The text is overambitious , and Britain ' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the `` Amsterdam left-overs '' in order to prepare for enlargement , and not expand far beyond these . 
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions . 
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation . 
The key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties . 
In our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are . 
Our priorities ( i.e. the `` left-overs '' ) must be : 
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners 
weighting of votes in the Council 
extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe ( but not Treaty change , defence matters , border controls or taxation ) , and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended 
Beyond this , we have concerns that the `` flexibility '' or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present . 
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation . 
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment , talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia , racism , etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted . 
However , I do wonder about the wisdom of this .
